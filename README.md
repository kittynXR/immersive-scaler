## Requirements

- Unity 2019.4.31f1 or later
- VRChat SDK 3.7.0 or later
- NDMF (Non-Destructive Modular Framework) - Automatically installed with VCC

## Features

### üéØ Precise Avatar Scaling
- **Target Height Control** - Set exact avatar height in meters
- **Proportional Body Scaling** - Separate controls for arms, legs, and torso
- **Multiple Measurement Methods** - Total height, eye height, or custom measurements
- **Real-time Measurement Display** - See current avatar stats instantly

### üîß Advanced Proportioning
- **Upper Body Percentage** - Fine-tune torso vs leg proportions (30-75% range)
- **Bone Thickness Control** - Adjust arm/leg thickness independently from length
- **Thigh/Calf Ratio** - Control leg shape and proportions
- **Hand & Foot Scaling** - Toggle scaling for extremities

### üõ°Ô∏è Non-Destructive Workflow
- **NDMF Integration** - Scaling applied during build, not in editor
- **Original State Preservation** - Can revert all changes anytime
- **Preview Mode** - See results before committing to build
- **ViewPosition Sync** - Automatically adjusts VRChat eye position

### üìê Professional Measurement System
- **Multiple Arm Measurement Methods** - Head-to-elbow (VRC standard), head-to-hand, arm length
- **Bone vs Mesh-based Calculations** - Choose measurement method that fits your avatar
- **Visual Measurement Indicators** - Scene gizmos show measurement points
- **Auto-population** - Automatically detect current avatar measurements

### ‚ö° Workflow Optimization
- **Build-time Processing** - No permanent changes to your scene
- **Component Auto-removal** - Keeps your scene clean after processing
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed feedback for troubleshooting
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases and complex avatars

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Open Immersive Scaler**: Go to `Tools > ‚öôÔ∏èüé® kittyn.cat üêü > üêü Immersive Avatar Scaler`
2. **Add Component**: Click "Add VRChat Immersive Scaler" to your avatar root
3. **Set Target Height**: Enter your desired avatar height in meters
4. **Configure Proportions**: Adjust upper body percentage and bone thickness
5. **Build Avatar**: Use VRChat SDK build panel - scaling happens automatically

### Common Workflows

#### Basic Height Adjustment
```
1. Add Immersive Scaler component to avatar root
2. Set target height (e.g., 1.75m for average human)
3. Leave other settings at defaults
4. Build avatar - scaling applied automatically
```

#### Fine-tuning Proportions
```
1. Set target height first
2. Adjust "Upper Body Percentage" (40-50% typical)
3. Modify arm/leg thickness as needed (80-100%)
4. Preview changes with scene gizmos
5. Build when satisfied with proportions
```

#### Professional Avatar Scaling
```
1. Use "Auto-populate measurements" to get current stats
2. Choose appropriate measurement method for your avatar
3. Fine-tune thigh/calf ratios for realistic leg shape
4. Adjust hand/foot scaling based on art style
5. Use preview mode to verify before final build
```

### Advanced Features

#### Measurement Methods
- **Total Height** - Measures from lowest to highest point
- **Eye Height** - Measures from avatar's eye level to floor
- **Custom** - Use your own measurement points

#### Arm Scaling Options
- **Head to Elbow (VRC Standard)** - Matches VRChat's arm length calculation
- **Head to Hand** - Full arm reach measurement
- **Arm Length** - Upper arm + forearm length combined

#### Proportioning Controls
- **Upper Body Percentage** - How much of total height is torso (30-75%)
- **Arm Thickness** - Retain original arm thickness (0-100%)
- **Leg Thickness** - Retain original leg thickness (0-100%)
- **Thigh/Calf Ratio** - Control leg shape proportions

#### Special Features
- **Keep Head Size** - Scales torso instead of head for cartoon avatars
- **Extra Leg Length** - Add extra height for ground clearance
- **Model Centering** - Automatically centers avatar at world origin
- **Finger Spreading** - Adjust finger positions for better IK

## Why Immersive Scaler?

### Traditional Scaling Problems:
- Destructive changes to your avatar
- Requires external tools like Blender
- Complex bone scaling calculations
- ViewPosition desync issues
- Permanent scene modifications

### Immersive Scaler Solutions:
- **Non-destructive** - Changes only applied during build
- **Unity-native** - No external tools required
- **Intelligent proportioning** - Realistic body ratios
- **Automatic ViewPosition** - Perfect eye height sync
- **Clean workflow** - No permanent scene changes

## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Natural Proportions
- Use 40-50% upper body percentage for realistic humans
- Keep arm/leg thickness at 80-100% for natural look
- Adjust thigh/calf ratio based on avatar style
- Enable hand/foot scaling for cartoon avatars

### Troubleshooting
- Use "Auto-populate measurements" for accurate baselines
- Switch measurement methods if results look off
- Check avatar hierarchy - root should be at avatar base
- Use preview mode to verify before building

#### Floor Measurement Issues
If your avatar's floor is being detected far below the actual feet:
- This happens when mesh bounds extend beyond visible geometry
- Common causes: blend shapes, hidden meshes, or incorrect bounds from modeling software
- **Solution**: Enable "Use Bone-Based Floor" in Advanced Options
- This uses foot/toe bone positions instead of mesh bounds for accurate floor detection

### Performance Considerations
- Immersive Scaler adds no runtime overhead
- Component automatically removes itself after build
- No impact on avatar performance ranking
- Compatible with all VRChat features
